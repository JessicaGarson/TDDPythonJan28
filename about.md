# Test Driven Development

## Why test?
Testing is the best way to figure out if your code works the way you think it does. It also helps you write better more reliable code. It also saves you times because testing is easy but debugging is hard. I like to think of testing as preventative debugging.

## Why places don't test
It's hard. Testing often requires a culture change in an organization and it requires you to rethink the way you write code.

## Don't look at testing as paperwork that needs to get done.

We know it's something we should do but don't, and it is simply an engineering task that needs to get done.

## But really everyone tests in some way
Usually, the tests that are created aren't good or useable.

## What makes a test good
Good tests are repeatable, fast, informative, reliable, and focused.

## The . addicted

Each test you pass you get a . for and folks who are super into testing often refer to themselves as . addictive.

## Your functions, they do too much
Since you need to test as much as possible your functions will start to do less

## What is test driven development

When you start with testing to create your programs instead of writing code and adjusting. You use the tests to drive your process.

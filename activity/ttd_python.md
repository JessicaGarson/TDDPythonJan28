# TTD activity
The best way to learn TDD is to try out yourself.

## Step 1
Come up with an idea of a simple python program to run. Should be run on the command line. Avoid using raw input. Strings and math are a good way to get started.

## Step 2
Figure out what the outcomes will be.

## Step 3
Write the tests. Check out the resources section if you get stuck here.

## Step 3
Run the tests. These should fail.

## Step 4
Now write the code you will need for these tests to be successful.

## Step 5
Did your tests pass? Yay skip to step 7.

## Step 6
Refactor your code to make your tests pass.

## Step 7
Play around. What happens if you make changes to your code? Do your tests always pass? Maybe try to make them fail. 

## Step 8
Submit a pull request on this repo with your groups code.
